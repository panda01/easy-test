# server/controllers/

Route registrars. One file per API section.

| File | Routes |
|---|---|
| `health.ts` | `GET /api/health` |
| `websites.ts` | `GET`/`POST /api/websites`, `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/websites/:websiteId` |
| `useCases.ts` | `GET`/`POST /api/websites/:websiteId/use-cases`, `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/websites/:websiteId/use-cases/:useCaseId` |
| `actions.ts` | `GET`/`POST /api/websites/:websiteId/actions`, `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/websites/:websiteId/actions/:actionId` |

## The convention

Each file exports a single `register<Section>Routes(app: Express): void` that
declares **full literal paths**:

```ts
export function registerHealthRoutes(app: Express): void {
  app.get("/api/health", (_req, res) => { ... });
}
```

`server.ts` calls each registrar in turn. Registration order is not significant.

**There is no `express.Router()` anywhere**, and that is deliberate: with full
literal paths, grepping for `"/api/health"` finds the route in one hop, rather
than requiring you to work out which prefix a router was mounted under.

Every route carries a JSDoc block with an `@route` tag naming the method and
path, a `@param` for each path parameter and body, and its `@returns` shape
including error statuses. `@route` is registered with eslint-plugin-jsdoc in
`eslint.config.ts`. Following the tsdoc preset, JSDoc carries **no `{Type}`
braces** - TypeScript already holds the types.

## CRUD route conventions

- **Status codes:** `201` + the row on create, `200` + the row on read/replace,
  `204` with no body on delete, `400 { error }` for an invalid body,
  `404 { error }` for a missing or soft-deleted row, `409 { error }` for a
  duplicate active website URL, `500 { error }` otherwise.
- **Replace, not patch:** `PUT` takes the full body; there is no `PATCH`.
- **Bodies are validated** by `../utils/validateRequestBodies.ts` before any
  query runs. Handlers pass `req.body` whole (it is `any`, and may be
  `undefined` in Express 5) rather than reading fields off it.
- **Deletes are soft.** See `../prisma/README.md`.
- **Nested routes check the parent first.** Use case and action routes look up
  the website and answer `404 "Website not found"` before touching the child.
- **Handlers leave `req`/`res` unannotated.** Express infers
  `req.params.websiteId` as `string` from the literal path; an explicit
  `Request` annotation widens params to `string | string[]`.
- **Errors go through `describeError`** (`../utils/describeError.ts`), so the
  "is it an Error?" branch lives in one tested place.
