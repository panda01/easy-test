# server/controllers/

Route registrars. One file per API section.

| File | Routes |
|---|---|
| `health.ts` | `GET /api/health` |

## The convention

Each file exports a single `register<Section>Routes(app: Express): void` that
declares **full literal paths**:

```ts
export function registerHealthRoutes(app: Express): void {
  app.get("/api/health", (_req, res) => { ... });
}
```

`server.ts` calls each registrar in turn. Registration order is not significant.

**There is no `express.Router()` anywhere**, and that is deliberate: with full
literal paths, grepping for `"/api/health"` finds the route in one hop, rather
than requiring you to work out which prefix a router was mounted under.

Every route carries a JSDoc block with an `@route` tag naming the method and
path, its `@param`s, and its `@returns` shape including error statuses.
